      <div>Blog::content - I bet this website will have few to zero traffic, so it's a good place to dump my personal opinion about any topic that comes by with any second thought of who will read it. And even if someone happens to let himself drop by, it's rest assured that he won't feel offended for what he's reading. Eventually, "who who does not accept others' advise, shouldn't take others' critics either".</div>
